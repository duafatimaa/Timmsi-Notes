# Timmsi-Meeting-Notes
As part of our hiring management process at Timmsi, we are developing a strategy for effectively reaching out to potential candidates and inviting them to apply for open positions within our company. We have organized all relevant applicant information on an Excel spreadsheet, including their qualifications and experience.

To ensure a streamlined and efficient process, we have designated a section on the right side of the spreadsheet for all call details related to the interview process. This includes information such as the date and time of the initial phone screen, the name and contact information of the interviewer, and any notes or feedback from the call.

By keeping all of this information organized in one place, we can better manage the hiring process and ensure that all communication with candidates is professional and consistent. Our goal is to attract top talent to our company and provide a positive experience for all applicants throughout the hiring process.
